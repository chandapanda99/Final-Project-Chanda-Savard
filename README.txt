Aayush and Emile's Final Project

PONG
HOW TO RUN IT
1. Open Package
2. Run Pong
3. Choose the option that you want to play
    Speed Pong! is a mode that makes you hit a ball with a paddle against a wall without missing it as much as possible
    Two Player Mode is a mode that is the regular two player Pong, where you hit a ball back and forth with paddles
    Epileptic Pong! is a mode where you play Speed Pong! but everything is changing colors rapidly
    Epileptic Two Player is a mode where you play Two Player Mode, but everything is changing colors rapidly as well
4. W to move up, S to move down for 1 player, and arrow keys for 2 player
5. If you are prone to seizures or get light-headed very easily, you probably shouldn't play Seizure Pong or Epileptic Two Player
6. Enjoy!!
